A basic recreation of the You Are An Idiot troll

# Slight Epileptic Seizure Warning
This project contains rapidly moving windows with black to white flashing GIFs.
Please take caution if you are prone.

# Warning
I would reccomend closing all other tabs/saving all progress before activating the troll.
It can easily make your browser very hard to use, and cause a LOT of lag on your computer if triggered multiple times.

# Controls
2: Disarm the troll; 4: Activate the troll

You will usually have to quit your browser to close the windows, but if you are fast enough, you can click on one of them and press 2 to stop them from moving.

# Note
The source was made quickly and is most likely heavily deprecated in most modern browsers.
On certain browsers, you way need to allow `*all*` popups for this site.
